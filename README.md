## Handling Project Data
For this group project on Covid-19 cases/deaths vs vaccinations, we will take the raw datasets for cases and vaccinations, process them into one combined dataset, then load that new data into our machine learning models. Among the plethora of information in our raw datasets, **we expect to work with a relatively concise dataset** that includes at least the following factors: **date, location, total cases, total deaths, and cumulative vaccines administered**. Certainly, with further group discussion, **we will consider adding or changing the factors related to Covid-19 cases and vaccinations**. Since our project goal is to **identify correlations between established vaccination trends and what the CDC been seen thus far from Covid-19 cases**, **we are leaning towards supervised machine learning to predict future Covid-19 cases** based on all this information. That is not to say that unsupervised learning is of no use. On paper, **by feeding raw data of Covid-19 cases to an unsupervised learning model, we could identify the most significant factors that will better inform our subsequent ETL process and supervised learning**. Nevertheless, we will only consult unsupervised learning if the scale of our project demands it or if we want to add more relevant inputs to our analysis.
