## Handling Project Data
For this group project on Covid-19 cases/deaths vs vaccinations, we will take the raw datasets for cases and vaccinations, process them into one combined dataset, then load that new data into our machine learning models. Among the plethora of information in our raw datasets, we expect to work with a more concise dataset that includes at least the following factors: date, location, total cases, total deaths, and cumulative vaccines administered. Certainly, with further group discussion, we will consider adding or changing the factors related to Covid-19 cases and vaccinations. Since our project goal is to identify correlations between vaccinations and Covid-19 case outcomes, we will definitely use supervised learning
