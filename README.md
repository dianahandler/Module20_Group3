# Module20_Group3

## Selected Topic
Examination of the potential relationships between Covid-19 cases and vaccination rates across (5) five US states.

## Reason why we selected our topic
For over a year, the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the lives and wellbeing globally. The number of cases and the recommended practices were observed closely since it first hit various regions and to today. With the plethora of data from government entities and institutions, our group wanted to work with such robust and recent data. 

## Description of our source of data
We searched for the multiple datasets, and jointly chose to utilize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") datasets for this project. The CDC has been the institution that has been providing the research and recommendations for disease control; and therefore, we believed it would have reputable data sets for analysis. See link here for example: < https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home >.

## Questions we hope to answer with our data
One of the biggest questions we hope to have insight on after analysis is whether vaccines had any effect to the behavior of the number of COVID-19 cases. We also would like to understand the differences and similarities among the five US states, and predict future behavior as well through our machine learning model. 

## Description of our communication protocols
Group 3 will be mainly using Slack and in class project time to communicate. If necessary, outside project meetings will be held.
